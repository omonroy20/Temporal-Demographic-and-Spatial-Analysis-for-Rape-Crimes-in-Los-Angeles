# Temporal-Demographic-and-Spatial-Analysis-for-Rape-Crimes-in-Los-Angeles
Statistical analysis project where we used data procured from the LAPD based on crime from the 2010's. The purpose was to create a poster giving visual information on rape crimes in Los Angeles. Such information included the times when these crimes occurred, the demographic of the victims, and a heatmap of where these crimes happened within LA county.
